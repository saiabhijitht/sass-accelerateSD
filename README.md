# Sustainability Assessment & Accreditation System(SAAS)

SAAS is a Robust Technology driven Platform to engage Citizens, Companies & Investors to take a pledge and to create a Roadmap & Action plan.
## What are the Project goals?
This project aims to collect and analyse few KPIs from citizens, companies and partners associated with us and provide accreditation for them based on their activities/actions of sustainable practices towards the environment. Further, we can provide rewards or incentives based on their accreditation score to encourage people following this path of growth.

To get started with our mission, we are building a Mobile App where people can
- Signup and create account in SAAS
- Create their own pledge
- Schedule reminders to update pledge status
- View score in their profile
